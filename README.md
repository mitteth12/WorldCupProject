In this project I look at a general overview of the data I have for the World Cup then answer two questions from the data.

The first question I look to answer is:

What country is consistently better at placing when being in the semi-finals? 

This would mean if a country like the USA were to get to the semi-finals, do they statistically have a better chance of making it to the finals over Germany? Basically I am looking for which countries consistently perform in the big games.

The second question I look to answer is:

Does the continent that the World Cup is played at have any weight to the performance of countries?

Essentially do South American countries play better than other countries if the Cup is played in Brazil.
